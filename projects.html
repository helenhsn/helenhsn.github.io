                        <ul>
                            <li> In a team of 5, we implemented a complete compiler for a sub language of Java (called
                                Deca, specifically created by our school for this project) which contains basic concepts
                                of Java, such as : loops (iterative, conditional), object oriented concepts (child,
                                parent) and operations. Our job also included to add a huge database of tests to make
                                sure our implementation of the compiler was robust. </li>
                            <li> This project lasted a whole month during which we had to go through several precise
                                steps, including: a parser, a lexer (semantics) and generating assembly code and write
                                the corresponding tests before coding or in the meantime. </li>
                            <li> During this whole month, we worked in Agile method and had weekly meetings with a
                                school tutor who was following our advancement.</li>
                            <li> We also got to implement an extension for this sub-language which involved the use of
                                static arrays (of N dimensions). Our final note for this project was 16.5/20 </li>

                            <li> Given a 3D mesh of a humand head made of an enormous amount of points, we had, as a
                                team, to reconstruct a simpler version of a part of that face using geometry modeling
                                (Bézier curves, B-splines and least square method). </li>
                            <li> The first step was to select a zone of the head for which we constructed an

                                learn properly object oriented programming.</li>
                            <li>Robots share both common and indivual properties (speed, water capacity, etc) and are
                                directed by a chef robot which is invisible in the simulation. </li>
                            <li>The chef robot is supposed to be intelligent as it needs to place the robots in order to
                                put out the fires as quickly as possible. Therefore, the project also contains an
                                optimization part: for instance, we used Djikstra algorithm to compute the smallest path
                                between an input point (robot position) and a set of target points (fires or puddles).

                        <ul>
                            <li> BlackSeas is a navigation/exploration game taking place in an infinite procedural world
                                made moslty of archipelagos and deep water.</li>
                            <li> The purpose of this project was to learn how to build a fully functional 3D multiplayer
                                game with some friends, which means that the game (BlackSeas) has been implemented from
                                scratch as well as the game engine (Gear) on which it is based on.</li>
                            <li> Gear had been started in summer 2022 and we began the development of BlackSeas in early
                                2023. </li>
                            <li> Even though this project was a huge challenge for the four of us as it used many
                                complicated and diverse concepts of video games development, we still really had fun
                                doing it. </li>
                            <li> The repartition of the work was the following: one friend was in charge of handling the
                                3D collisions (physics), another one implemented the "multiplayer" part (network) of the
                                game and the game engine.
                                One other friend had to generate and render every element related to the sky and
                                archipelagos in
                                BlackSeas. As for me, I implemented everything related to the ocean (generation,
                                shading,
                                buoyancy).
                            <li>
                            <li>Note: We did not have a great application
                                to record our screen so the video might start with a little bit of delay and shows some
                                lags. The game in itself runs in real-time (more than 120 fps with an
                                RTX 3050, for instance). </li>

                            </li>
                            <li>It contains a procedural island which heightmap is generated using compute shaders. The
                                form of the island is obtained by combining fractional Brownian motion and a sum of
                                gaussian functions which are flattened by a smoothstep function. The color is obtained
                                by doing a linear interpolation of multiple colors given the height of the island (I did
                                not have time to make proper colors using the normal instead). </li>
                            <li>The ocean is generated by computing the Fast Fourier transform algorithm via a pipeline
                                of compute shaders. This method is heavily inspired by Tessendorf's article and some
                                other articles regarding the use of compute shaders to parallelize the FFT. I also added
                                some reflection of
                                the skybox on the ocean (visible on the waves' crest). The ocean grids are displayed
                                using GPU instancing (one draw call for the whole ocean).</li>
                            <li>Volcano eruptions are made using two particle systems which are initialized on CPU and
                                updated on GPU (using compute shaders and SSBOs).</li>
                            <li>The scene contains also other elements such as fog (done via post-processing with the
                                use of FBOs), keyframe animated windmills and animals, a skybox (simple cubemap)...
                            </li>
                            <li> I implemented every element in the scene except the keyframe animations.
                                Some elements might be highly improved (the eruption, for example which is not quite
                                realistic) as we did this whole
                                project in only 2-3 weeks.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li> Here is one of my first shaders, created after one to
                                two weeks of learning about shaders (scattered between school and my part-time job).
                            </li>
                            <li> This was realized by using simple raymarching
                                techniques and fBm (fractional Brownian motions) for everything that concerns waves and
                                for the dirt on the hill. I added some textures and displacement to the dirt to give it
                                a stony aspect. </li>
                            <li> The framerate of this shader is actually really low
                                (runs at 16-20fps on my 15.6 laptop with an RTX 3050 as a gpu) but this is probably due
                                to the high number of calls to the fBm function or the high maximum distance for the
                                raymarching function. </li>
                            <li> Don't hesitate to check my other shaders on

                        <ul>
                            <li> Graphical interface built from scratch allowing the
                                user to cast light (rays) on edges and curves. </li>
                            <li> The user can draw curves by placing points on the
                                screen. Each fragment of curve drawn correspond to a cubic Bézier curve which is
                                connected to the following curve with a C² junction. Therefore, the global curve (made
                                of all the fragments) drown actually represents a spline. It is possible to draw several
                                splines on the screen by switching to another button of the panel and going back to the
                                'Curves' button.</li>
                            <li> It is also possible to move the curve and change its
                                appearance by sliding the white point (see examples below). </li>
                            <li> The number of rays displayed in the screen can be set
                                up to 3000 using only edges, and up to 250 using Bézier curves. </li>
                            <li> This project allowed me to apply directly my
                                mathematical knowledge (regarding geometry modeling) to a concrete project. It also
                                enabled me to work again on evenemential programming, optimization and other aspects of
                                programming. </li>
