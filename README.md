## Description

Small responsive website built from scratch to display my projects and my education, available here : [My personal website](https://helenhsn.github.io/).

I try to update it as often as possible (based on the progress of my knowledge in web development).

Don't hesitate to leave me a message if you detect any bug or have any recommandation! And if you have any question about the content, don't hesitate to ask, I'll be happy to answer!

Enjoy ! :)
