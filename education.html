                        <li>Here are some of the drawings I've made in the last years. I only use pencils with different
                            graphite according to the level of precision that I need (shadow, facial features...). </li>
                        <li> I've learned to draw by myself when I was little mostly by repoducing pictures that I had
                            taken or by trying to draw objects in my room. As long as I remember, I've always liked the
                            idea of repoducing reality in its tiniest details. </li>
                        <li> As I grew up, I started drawing invented characters although some of the faces below are
                            probably unconsciously a mix of the people I see in my everyday life. </li>
