                    <ul>
                        <li> Internship in R&D under the supervision of Louis DEVEZE within the Computer Vision
                            laboratory at Eviden, Echirolles. I integrated a team that builds an application based on
                            Omniverse Kit, which is a SDK implemented by NVIDIA. The purpose of the application is to
                            generate large synthetic datasets (based on 3D scenes) which will serve as train/test sets
                            for AI models created
                            by another team in the laboratory. </li>

                        <li> My goal for these 15 weeks was to integrate visual effects (fire and rain, especially)
                            inside
                            the application using NVIDIA Omniverse's ecosystem. This way, I got to discover many new
                            concepts that came with this fairly recent platform which aims for creating both virtual and
                            real-time workflows. </li>

                        <li> Overall, I intensively used the USD format which is at the center of Omniverse workflow as
                            well as
                            many extensions within the ecosystem, such as: Omnigraph (similar to Blueprints in Unreal
                            Engine), Flow (fluid dynamics
                            extension...), etc. In
                            particular, I heavily relied on the Warp extension which contains python wrappers to
                            CUDA/C++ context in Omniverse and allowed me to make a rain particle system from scratch in
                            the application.</li>

                            internship report I have written for school. It also contains a quick introduction to NVIDIA
                            Omniverse (which can be daunting at first) and USD, as well as links.</li>
