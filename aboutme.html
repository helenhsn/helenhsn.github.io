                            <ul>
                                <li> I am a soon-to-be junior engineer in computer science and applied mathematics that holds a keen interest for anything that comes near
                                    computer graphics, high performance computing and physics simulation. </li>
                                <li> 
                                    Ever since I discovered computer graphics in late 2022 and became passionate about it, I tackled many projects 
                                    that involved various rendering techniques as well as computational physics concepts which are exposed in the Projects section.
                                    Each of them did satisfy my curiosity but I knew something important was missing when working on GPU: 
                                    I did not know how this piece of hardware worked at all (or at least, not in details)! </li>

                                <li>
                                    So, I started to learn about it, first by taking classes. But the more I learned about GPUs, 
                                    the eager I became to work with them because their architecture completely changed the way I conceived and implemented algorithms 
                                    (for example the Fast Fourier Transform). It made me realize that most iterative algorithms I had learned at school or elsewhere
                                    are not actually meant to be coded that way and should (ought to) be parallelized in order to take advantage of the hardware.
                                    Fascinating, isn't it?
                                </li>
                                <li id="last"> When I'm not programming, you'll probably find me climbing on walls or rocks
                                    with my friends (there are pretty good climbing spots here in Grenoble!). I also have a
                                    deep appetency for video/board games, music and drawing for which you can find
                                    some examples I have made in the last few years at the end of Education section. </li>
